# This is Very Very Simple Just UI Flutter App

Flutter is an interesting project for me. After android development ı think flutter makes thing very easy. 

## About App 
This app can be called as Quiz app. There is a Landing Page, Quiz Page, and Score Page. Questions are hard coded this means ı did not use a database. The project can be developed and ı have same ideas but for now, this is the final. 

**_Features that can be added_**
***
1. Database
2. Login Page
3. Some complex analysis and visualization 
4. Creating your own quiz and publishing it
